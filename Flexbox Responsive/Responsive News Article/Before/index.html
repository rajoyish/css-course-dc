          <h1>UK demands access to Apple users' encrypted data</h1>
          <p>
            The UK government has demanded to be able to access encrypted data
            stored by Apple users worldwide in its cloud service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently only the Apple account holder can access data stored in
            this way. The tech giant itself cannot view it.

          <p>
            TikTok is being sued by the parents of four British teenagers who
            believe their children died after taking part in viral trends that
            circulated on the video-sharing platform in 2022.

          <p>
            The lawsuit claims Isaac Kenevan, Archie Battersbee, Julian "Jools"
            Sweeney and Maia Walsh died while attempting the so-called "blackout
            challenge".

          <h1>Google remakes Super Bowl ad after AI cheese gaffe</h1>
          <p>
            Google has re-edited an advert for its leading artificial
            intelligence (AI) tool, Gemini, after it overestimated the global
            appetite for Gouda.
          </p>
          <p>
            The commercial - which was supposed to showcase Gemini's abilities -
            was created to be broadcast during the Super Bowl.
